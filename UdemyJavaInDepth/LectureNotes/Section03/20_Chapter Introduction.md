Hi there, this is Dheeru Mundluru. And welcome back.

In this section, we will get started with the language basic series which also includes a few other follow-up sections.

As the title of the section says, people look at classes something called objects, under fundamental units that make up classes and objects.

So let's look at the agenda for the section.

Java is an object-oriented programming language.

And so, we begin this section by discussing about object-oriented environment and it's use in modeling real world scenarios.

And for this, we will introduce Java's two of the most fundamental object-oriented concepts, called class and object.

And we will understand these concepts conceptually and also see how they can be created in

Java.

we will next look at some absolute basic coding constructs in Java, which we need to know before we start programming in Java.

Our next few lectures will include an in-depth coverage of variables.

A variable is a basic unit of a class and is responsible for holding data.

That is it is basically like a container.

While a variable and its very basic form can hold a single value, we often also need variables that can hold a group of values.

And for that, we can use an array.

So, we will next look at an array, which would be our first data structure of the course.

An array is also one of the most basic data structures any programming language supports.

Other sophisticated structures will be discussed in the collections framework section, which comes later in the course.

While variables help with holding a software's data, a software also needs something to encapsulate its business logic. And that's where methods come in.

And next few lectures will include an in-depth coverage of methods.

Like a variable, a method is also a basic unit of a class.

So, a software business logic or algorithms will be part of methods.

And finally, we will look at something called constructors, which as the name implies, help in constructing something.

And that something would be objects.

So, constructors help with creating objects.

So, that's the agenda.

And in this course, we will take a top-down approach in learning the basics of the Java

language.

That is, instead of getting into the really really details of the language,

we first understand how Java as an object-oriented programming language helps more than real world scenarios using classes and objects.

And then we look at their constituent components.

We would also write several demo programs as we go along.

And you would also be given a few coding exercises that would help validate and also reinforce what you have learned.

So, that is it. 

And now, let's go ahead and get started with the section.

Thank you.
